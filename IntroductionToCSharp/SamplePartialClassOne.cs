//****************************   **PART 62  (Creating partial classes)  ******************************//
/* 
 * 1. All the parts spread across different files, must use the partial keyword
 * 2. All the parts spread across different files, must have the same access modifiers
 * 3. If any of the parts are declared abstract, the the entire type is considered abstract
 * 4. If any of the parts are declared sealed, then the entire type is considered sealed
 * 5. If any of the parts inherit a class, then the entire type inherits that class
 * 6. C# does not support multipe class inheritance. Difference parts of the partial class, must not specify different base classes.
 * 7. Different parts of the partial class can specify different base interfaces, and the final type implements all of the interfaces listed by all of the partial declarations
 * 8. Any members that are declared in a partial definition are available to all of the other parts of the partail class.
